# Check Inventory is empty (assuming '?' or empty)
# I need to know what "Empty" looks like. In HUD.tsx it renders `?` if item exists.
# So if empty, text `?` is NOT visible in slot 0?
# Actually my HUD code: `{player?.inventory[i] ? <Text>?</Text> : null}`
# So slot 0 should NOT contain "?".

# Move to Chest (Simulated or assuming spawn is close)
# The Starting Town gen puts a "chest_gold" at (0, 1, 0).
# Player spawns at (0, 5, 0) and falls.
# They should be very close.
