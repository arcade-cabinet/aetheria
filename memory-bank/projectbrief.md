# Project Brief: Aetheria

## Vision
**Aetheria: The Fractured Realm** is a procedural simulationist RPG where the world is not fixed but reconstructed daily by "World-Singers". The player acts as an *Architect*, exploring and stabilizing realities in a "Dark Gothic" void.

## Core Pillars
1.  **Procedural Simulation:** The world is generated via logic (WFC/Noise) and simulated via physics (Havok). Construction is physical ("The Drop").
2.  **Dark Gothic Aesthetic:** High-contrast visuals, deep purples/golds, GlowLayer, SSAO, and 12px backdrop blur.
3.  **Hybrid Asset Strategy:** Procedural layouts populated by high-quality CC0 assets (Quaternius/KayKit), corrected to a uniform scale (1 Unit = 1 Meter).
4.  **Modern Stack:** React 19, BabylonJS 7+, Miniplex ECS, Havok WASM.

## Scope
-   **Platform:** Web (Mobile-First responsive).
-   **Phase:** Currently entering Phase 2 (Procedural Generation).
-   **Key Mechanic:** "The Drop" - World chunks fall from the sky and lock into place via physics.
