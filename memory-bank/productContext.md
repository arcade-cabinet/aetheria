# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Standard RPGs rely on static maps and pre-baked environments. Aetheria aims to solve "content fatigue" by making the *construction* of the world part of the gameplay loop.

## User Experience
1.  **Enter the Realm:** User sees a high-fidelity "Dark Gothic" landing page.
2.  **The Drop:** Upon starting, the world doesn't just "appear". Blocks and props fall from the sky (The Drop), physically stacking and settling. This provides visceral feedback.
3.  **Exploration:** The player controls a character (WASD/Touch) in a third-person view.
4.  **Interaction:** Raycasting allows inspection and manipulation of the world. "Architect Mode" (future) will allow placing blocks.

## Design Language
-   **Tone:** Eerie, majestic, solid.
-   **Audio:** Ambient loops (Tone.js) that evolve. Procedural thuds for impacts.
-   **UI:** "Glass Metallic" - Sharp borders, gold filigree, blurred backgrounds.
